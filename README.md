# Aviation Academy Data Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes **aviation academy training data** using Microsoft Excel.  
The dataset is visualized through an **interactive dashboard** that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as training activities, student test performance, and safety metrics.

##  Key Features
- **Average Test Score (68%)** – shows student performance across attempts.  
- **Total Landings (202)** – tracks flight practice outcomes.  
- **Hard Landings (14%)** – monitors safety-critical landings.  
- **Training Activities Analysis** – distribution of Flight, Ground, and Simulator sessions.  
- **Aircraft & Weather Insights** – breakdown of performance under different conditions.  
- **Status Report** – Pass/Fail/Incomplete distribution of trainees.  

##  Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel**  
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts  
- Slicers for interactive filtering  
- KPI Cards (Average Score, Total Landings, Hard Landings %)  
- Doughnut, Column, Line & Pie Charts  

##  Files
- `aviation_academy_data.xlsx` → Contains dataset, pivot tables, and the dashboard.

##  Insights
This dashboard helps aviation trainers and students to:
- Evaluate training performance.  
- Identify weak areas in test scores.  
- Monitor flight safety (hard landings, maintenance needs).  
- Make **data-driven decisions** for better training outcomes.
